Tutorial Review
This is a file to practice creating a branch off the master of GitHub. I'm very interested in learning the methodology behind GitHub and look forward to integrating it with the website so I can track all changes instead of emailing myself a thousand times. This is extra work I'm doing as we are at home during the quaranteen from COVID-19.
