Tutorial Review
This is a file to practice creating a branch off the master of GitHub. I'm very interested in learning the methodology behind GitHub and look forward to integrating it with the website so I can track all changes instead of emailing myself a thousand times. This is extra work I'm doing as we are at home during the quaranteen from COVID-19.
I am making one more change here to make sure I understand what the workflow and process is of creating Commits and then doing Pull Requests. Not completely complicated but I want to make sure I know what I'm doing.
